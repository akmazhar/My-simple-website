    <h3>My First Blog</h3>
    <p>I tend to embrace working under pressure because it forces me to become the best version of myself and act quickly and decisively. At my last job, I was told that a major client was arriving from overseas in just five hours, and I had to create a presentation for her arrival. I quickly overcame that initial sense of panic, took a deep breath and collected my thoughts, trying to figure out the best way of working on such short notice.</p>

    <h3>My Second Blog</h3>
    <p>Those five hours were both intense and stressful, but I managed to create a powerful presentation. I know stress tends to build up, but I eliminate it through yoga and meditation. Reading also relaxes me after a long day at work, refreshing my mind and making me ready to take up new challenges the next day.</p>

    <h3>My Third Blog</h3>
    <p>When I first began my administration career, I started as a temporary employee with a temp agency. 

        Because I was placed in a variety of roles that changed weekly and sometimes even daily, I often jumped into positions where there was a lot to learn in a short time. Deadlines were often extremely tight, and technology changed frequently. 
       
       I utilized and maximized my resources to the fullest, often learning technical tasks through YouTube tutorials the night before.
       
       I learned plenty of programs and software, and best of all, had fun doing it!"</p>
