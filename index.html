    <h3>My First website</h3>
    <p>I tend to embrace working under pressure because it forces me to become the best version of myself and act quickly and decisively. At my last job, I was told that a major client was arriving from overseas in just five hours, and I had to create a presentation for her arrival. I quickly overcame that initial sense of panic, took a deep breath and collected my thoughts, trying to figure out the best way of working on such short notice.</p>
